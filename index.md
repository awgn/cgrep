### Welcome to CGrep Home-Page.

> Cgrep is a grep tool suitable for searching in large code repositories. It supports kind of searches with several programming languages that go beyond the simple pattern matching. It enables context-aware filtering and semantic searches through wildcard and combinators.

### Features

* **Fine grained Multi-threading** with configurable number of jobs, tasks, and physical cores.

* **Blazing fast**. Running on a single core it is nearly as fast as GNU grep, up to 6x times faster than [ack](http://beyondgrep.com/).

* **Multi-line** pattern searches.

* **Automatic coloring** of tokens and strings matching when the output device is a terminal.

* **Recursive searches**. Support of language filters, pruning directories, per-project (local) and global configurations (cgreprc).

* **Classic searches** by means of Boyerâ€“Moore, Posix and PCRE regular expressions.

* **Code Tokenizer**. Search patterns in tokens, as prefix, infix, or suffix sub-strings and by means of the edit distance (Levenshtein).

* **Context-aware distinction between code, comments and literals**. Supportted langauges are Agda, Assembly, Awk, C, CMake, Cabal, Chapel, Clojure, Coffee, Conf, Cpp, Csharp, Css, D, Dart, Elm, Elixir, Erlang, Eta, Fortran, Fsharp, Go, Haskell, Html, Idris, Java, Javascript, Json, Kotlin, Latex, Lisp, Lua, Make, Nmap, OCaml, ObjectiveC, PHP, Perl, Python, R, Ruby, Rust, Scala, SmallTalk, Shell, Swift, Tcl Text, VHDL, Verilog, Vim, Yaml.

* **Semantic searches** through wildcards and combinators. _, _1, _2..., $, $1, $2..., ANY, KEY, STR, CHR, NUM, HEX, OCT, OR. E.g. "_1(_1 && $)" search for C++ move constructors, "struct OR class _ { OR : OR <" search for class declarations.

* **Customizable** output with format string, XML or JSON.

### Install

* Cgrep is available from [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/cgrep) and can be installed using [cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/) or [stack](https://www.stackage.org/) tool.

`cabal install cgrep`

or

`stack install cgrep`
