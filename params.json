{"name":"Cgrep","tagline":"Cgrep: a context-aware grep for source codes","body":"### Welcome to CGrep Home-Page.\r\n\r\n> Cgrep is a grep tool suitable for searching in large code repositories. It supports 30 programming languages and searches that go beyond the simple pattern matching. It enables context-aware filtering and semantic searches through wildcard combinators. \r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n* **Multi-threaded** with configurable number of jobs. \r\n\r\n* **Blazing fast**: Running on a single core it is nearly as fast as GNU grep, up to 6x times faster than ack.\r\n\r\n* **Multi-line** pattern searches.\r\n\r\n* **Colors** highlight of tokens and strings matching.\r\n\r\n* **Recursive searches**: Support of language filters and pruning directories.\r\n\r\n* **Standard searches**: through Boyer–Moore and Posix Regex.\r\n\r\n* **Code Tokenizer**: Searches as prefix, infix, suffix and edit distance (Levenshtein distance).\r\n\r\n* **Context-aware filters** distinguish among **code**, **comments** and **literals** in different languages.\r\n\r\n* **Support for**: Awk, C, Cpp, Chapel, Csharp, Css, CMake, D, Erlang, Fsharp, Go, Haskell, Html, Java, Javascript, Latex, Lua, Make, OCaml, ObjectiveC, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Scala, Tcl, Text, Shell, Verilog, VHDL, Vim.\r\n\r\n* **Semantic searches** through wildcards combinators. _, _1, _2..., $, $1, $2..., ANY, KEY, STR, CHR, NUM, HEX, OCT, OR. E.g. \"_1(_1 && $)\" search for move constructors, \"struct OR class _ { OR : OR <\" search for class declarations.\r\n\r\n* **Customizable output** with format string, xml and JSON back-ends.\r\n \r\n### Releases\r\n\r\n* The packages for Debian Wheezy and Jessie are available at https://github.com/awgn/cgrep/releases\r\n\r\n### Authors\r\n\r\nNicola Bonelli <nicola@pfq.io>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
